# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API system using AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The system will provide independent Lambda functions for each CRUD operation, handle JSON data with comprehensive validation, support all JSON data types, and include proper error handling with JSON responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to create new records through a REST endpoint, so that I can store data in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the create endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the incoming JSON data
2. WHEN the JSON data contains null values for required fields THEN the system SHALL return a validation error in JSON format
3. WHEN the JSON data has incorrect data types THEN the system SHALL return a data type validation error in JSON format
4. WHEN the validation passes THEN the system SHALL store the data in DynamoDB and return a success response in JSON format
5. WHEN an exception occurs during creation THEN the system SHALL return an error message in JSON format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to retrieve records through a REST endpoint, so that I can access stored data from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to retrieve a specific record THEN the system SHALL return the record data in JSON format
2. WHEN a GET request is made to retrieve all records THEN the system SHALL return a list of all records in JSON format
3. WHEN a requested record does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a not found error in JSON format
4. WHEN an exception occurs during retrieval THEN the system SHALL return an error message in JSON format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to update existing records through a REST endpoint, so that I can modify stored data in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to update a record THEN the system SHALL validate the incoming JSON data
2. WHEN the JSON data contains null values for required fields THEN the system SHALL return a validation error in JSON format
3. WHEN the JSON data has incorrect data types THEN the system SHALL return a data type validation error in JSON format
4. WHEN the validation passes and record exists THEN the system SHALL update the data in DynamoDB and return a success response in JSON format
5. WHEN the record to update does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a not found error in JSON format
6. WHEN an exception occurs during update THEN the system SHALL return an error message in JSON format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to delete records through a REST endpoint, so that I can remove unwanted data from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to delete a specific record THEN the system SHALL remove the record from DynamoDB
2. WHEN the record to delete exists THEN the system SHALL return a success response in JSON format
3. WHEN the record to delete does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a not found error in JSON format
4. WHEN an exception occurs during deletion THEN the system SHALL return an error message in JSON format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want each CRUD operation to be implemented as independent Lambda functions, so that I can scale and maintain each operation separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN there SHALL be four separate Lambda functions for create, read, update, and delete operations
2. WHEN any Lambda function is updated THEN it SHALL not affect the other Lambda functions
3. WHEN each Lambda function is invoked THEN it SHALL use the latest version of Python supported by AWS Lambda

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to work with comprehensive JSON data types, so that I can store and retrieve complex data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support string data types
2. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support integer data types
3. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support float/decimal data types
4. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support boolean data types
5. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support array data types
6. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support nested object data types
7. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL support null values for optional fields

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive data validation, so that I can ensure data integrity and receive clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return a JSON parsing error message
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return a validation error listing missing fields
3. WHEN field data types are incorrect THEN the system SHALL return a validation error specifying expected types
4. WHEN field values are out of acceptable ranges THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with acceptable ranges
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status code 400 with error details in JSON format

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error handling, so that I can properly handle exceptions in my client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any exception occurs THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with error details
2. WHEN a validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status code 400
3. WHEN a resource is not found THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status code 404
4. WHEN an internal server error occurs THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status code 500
5. WHEN an error response is returned THEN it SHALL include an error message and error code in JSON format
